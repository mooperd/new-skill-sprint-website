<h2>Credimi Case Study</h2>
<div class="box">
    <p>In both layman and nerd-speak, this is a paragraph. This is a paragraph that goes inside a box! Whoa so crazy. This is the text that goes under the heading and the subtitle. Paragraphs vary in length but in school we're taught to make them at least 7 sentences or else we risk getting a C. Since the paragraph didn't have a thesis or a closing argument, it's probably a C grade paragraph.</p>
