A Skill Sprint is an intense real-world learning experience for teams looking to embrace new technologies. The discipline is based on research by a number of academics into the way people learn. 

Skill Sprints can be used as a way of introducing people to tech - providing them a way of delivering their "first value" to their organisation whilst learning in their real environment. Skill Sprints can also help established development teams effectivly adopt new techniques or technologies such as DevOps or Kubernetes.

At its heart is the concept that people learn most effectively by “doing” and that the best place to learn a new skil is "on the job". Attempting to upskill people by putting them in training centers or bootcamps neglects the reality of how people learn and emotionally adopt new things.
