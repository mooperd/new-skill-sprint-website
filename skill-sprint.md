A Skill Sprint is an intense real-world learning experience for development teams looking to embrace new technologies. The discipline is based on research by a number of academics into the way people learn. At its heart is the concept that people learn most effectively by “doing” and that a one-week Skill Sprint developing a live product can empower a development team for a year.
