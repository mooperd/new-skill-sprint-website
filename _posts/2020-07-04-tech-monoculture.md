Theatrics is probably not a word that technologists want associated with their projects. There is a projection of steady development. A graceful swan making its way across the genteel lake. In reality tech is mostly some kind of improvised theatre. No one has a script, very few people have a clue and everyone is terrified of the reviews.

For some however, technology is very much a performance piece. I admire the way Elon Musk - a true theatre practitioner - performs the output of his companies. Launching his cherry red Tesla roadster into space on a ballet of technology was an effect not lost on many. At the time of writing, Tesla is worth more than Toyota despite Tesla producing about 3.5% of the volume of Toyota.

Technology dominates within business. It is the medium in which we paint our ideas. Tech has a major role in every success and every failure. Since 'these difficult times', tech has saved us from the worst ravages of lockdown - connecting us and saving us from ourselves.

Seasoned performers understand the stage - the subtlety of the wing and the power of the front and centre. Actors are able to use these positions to subliminally frame their work. Good actors will avoid front and centre unless they want to make a specific point. They use the whole stage to tell their story. We can see this with tech companies. Facebook insists on standing front and centre at all times - refusing to support in the wings. Other companies only hit that spot at specific times when they are ready to sing their aria. I should probably criticise Elon for his domination of the stage but I didn't grow weary of him yet. We have our heroes and our villains, comedies and tragedies and plenty of high drama.

in 1984 The American educational theorist, David Kolb, described four distinct learning styles or modes. 

Technology is something of a autodidactic monoculture. People that make it into tech often have a stronger aptitude for focusing on tasks and self learning. This can sometimes be at the expense of social aptitude. This rather narrow spectrum is causing stagnancy in significant portions of the industry as effective communication is often much more important than 'engineering' in many situations.



<h3>Assimilating (watching and thinking - AC/RO)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The assimilating learning preference involves a concise, logical approach. Ideas and concepts are more important than people.</p>

<p>These people require good clear explanation rather than a practical opportunity. They excel at understanding wide-ranging information and organizing it in a clear, logical format.</p>

<p>People with an assimilating learning style are less focused on people and more interested in ideas and abstract concepts.  People with this style are more attracted to logically sound theories than approaches based on practical value.</p>

<p>This learning style is important for effectiveness in information and science careers. In formal learning situations, people with this style prefer readings, lectures, exploring analytical models, and having time to think things through.</p>

Skill Sprints are designed to support people's entry into the tech stage. We teach you to perform your small piece from the wings - what are the cues, entries and exits? It will be quite some while before you will be front and center but we all have to start somewhere.
