Theatrics is probably not a word that technologists want associated with their projects. There is a projection of steady development. A graceful swan making its way across the genteel lake. In reality tech is mostly some kind of improvised theatre. No one has a script, very few people have a clue and everyone is terrified of the reviews.

For some however, technology is very much a performance piece. I admire the way Elon Musk - a true theatre practitioner - performs the output of his companies. Launching his cherry red Tesla roadster into space on a ballet of technology was an effect not lost on many. At the time of writing, Tesla is worth more than Toyota despite Tesla producing about 3.5% of the volume of Toyota.

Technology dominates within business. It is the medium in which we paint our ideas. Tech has a major role in every success and every failure. Since 'these difficult times', tech has saved us from the worst ravages of lockdown - connecting us and saving us from ourselves.

Seasoned performers understand the stage - the subtlety of the wing and the power of the front and centre. Actors are able to use these positions to subliminally frame their work. Good actors will avoid front and centre unless they want to make a specific point. They use the whole stage to tell their story. We can see this with tech companies. Facebook insists on standing front and centre at all times - refusing to support in the wings. Other companies only hit that spot at specific times when they are ready to sing their aria. I should probably criticise Elon for his domination of the stage but I didn't grow weary of him yet. We have our heroes and our villains, comedies and tragedies and plenty of high drama.

Technology is something of a monoculture as it preselects those who have the capability to self learn. Autodidacts are predominantly soloists with a tendency towards character traits which make collaborative processes rather difficult. This rather narrow spectrum is causing stagnancy in significant portions of the industry as effective communication is often more important than engineering in many situations. We desperately need to break open this status quo, but getting in fresh blood can be difficult. Significant barriers to entry exist - acquiring the relevant knowledge and survival within what can be a difficult and sometimes hostile environment.

Skill Sprints are designed to support people's entry into the tech stage. We teach you to perform your small piece from the wings - what are the cues, entries and exits? It will be quite some while before you will be front and center but we all have to start somewhere.
