Skill Sprints have been in development for the past 2 years. They have been used to efficiently introduce Dev teams to Google Cloud by focussing on **learning outcomes**, **ownership** and **value delivery**.

Skill Sprints are a one week process that delivers a production ready configuration to an end customer. Customers that have on-boarded with a skill sprint have **lower support costs** and **higher consumption**

Amazon Web Services deliver services to customers via DevOps engineers. Companies that have a DevOps / SRE / Platform engineers are less likely to consume Google because it is more difficult for them to add value to the process.

We find it extremely easy to teach Google Cloud to Developers and get them up and running efficiently because Google cloud is engineered for direct consumption by developers. This follows the pattern that exists within Google.
