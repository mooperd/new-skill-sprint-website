Whilst ubiquitous in modern business, spreadsheets suffer from some fatal flaws which make them inappropriate for many of the tasks that we use them for. Spreadsheets become very error prone if they exist for any length of time and re-running calculations on complex sheets can take a long time to complete - frustrating the efforts of your staff and reducing insight.

Investing in new technical skills for your employees is a tricky proposition. The ground is not always fertile for such initiatives and introducing a new technology into the department can create more problems than it solves.

Skill Sprints are designed to provide a concrete transformation of a business process within a training and coaching environment. Under the close guidance of the Skill Sprint leader, the participants deliver something small but useful to the business. Whilst the Skill Sprint leader will be available to support and advise ownership will remain with the participants after the Skill Sprint ends. 

Skill Sprints ensure that introducing a new technology happens in a structured and predictable way with clear responsibilities at every stage. Skill Sprints are discrete operations which are designed to ensure that stake-holders are equipped to make real decisions. Using Skill Sprints allows a healthier relationship between us and our clients without the codependency of traditional consultancies.

Python is the world’s most popular programming language and is used heavily for work such as data analysis and transforming data from one system to another. It has inbuilt functions for reading CSV and Excel files and can easily integrate data from any other source. 

Already the world’s most popular programming language; the popularity of Python is still growing much faster than any other. With an excellent set of add on modules python is extremely versatile and easy to use. It’s free to use with an open source licence.
